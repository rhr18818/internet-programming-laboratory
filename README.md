# Internet Programming Lab Projects: A Summary of Web Development Exercises

Hello,

This repository contains a collection of web development projects completed as part of my Internet Programming Laboratory course. These projects were designed to provide practical experience with front-end and back-end web development technologies, demonstrating an understanding of key concepts and techniques.

## Project Overview

The repository includes three distinct projects, each progressively building upon the skills acquired throughout the course:

1.  **Dynamic CGPA Calculator:**
    *   This project provides a user-friendly interface for calculating a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). It allows users to dynamically add and remove course inputs, specifying grades and credit hours for each.
    *   **Key Features:**  Dynamic form manipulation using JavaScript, CGPA calculation logic implemented in PHP, user-centric design.
    *   **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
    *   **Detailed Documentation:** [README-cgpa-calculator.md](./README-cgpa-calculator.md)
    *   **Focus:** Front-end interactivity and back-end data processing.

2.  **Basic Client-Side Registration Form:**
    *   This project is a fundamental example of a form-based web application. It collects user input and displays the submitted data on the same page using JavaScript.
    *   **Key Features:** Form input handling, real-time data display via JavaScript, foundational front-end design.
    *   **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
     *   **Location:** Main repository folder.
    *   **Focus:** Understanding form elements and client-side data management.

3.  **Database-Integrated Student Registration Form:**
    *   This project demonstrates a complete web application with database interaction. It handles user registration, including data validation and storage in a MySQL database.
    *   **Key Features:** Form submission, back-end data processing in PHP, database interaction using MySQL, duplicate entry detection.
    *   **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.
     *  **Location:** Main repository folder.
    *   **Focus:** Server-side data management, database integration, and secure data handling.

## Core Learning Outcomes

These projects collectively contributed to several key learning outcomes:

*   **Web Development Fundamentals:** Gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating user interfaces and interactive web pages.
*   **Server-Side Scripting:** Demonstrated the ability to use PHP for handling form submissions, processing data, and managing database interactions.
*   **Database Management:** Acquired practical experience in database design, data storage, and retrieval using MySQL.
*   **Problem-Solving:** Enhanced debugging and problem-solving skills through practical application.
*   **Full-Stack Principles:** Understood the interaction between front-end presentation and back-end data management.

## Purpose of Sharing

This repository serves as a documentation of the practical exercises completed during the course. It showcases the application of theoretical concepts learned in the laboratory setting and aims to provide a clear view of each project's implementation and technical considerations.
